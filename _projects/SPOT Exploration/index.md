## Overview
Autonomy stack for **semantic exploration and dense object mapping** with Boston Dynamics **Spot**. The system separates **mapping** and **planning** concerns, then couples them through a clean interface: mapping delivers reliable background and object-level models; planning guarantees coverage and required multi-view object observations with short, consistent paths. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
