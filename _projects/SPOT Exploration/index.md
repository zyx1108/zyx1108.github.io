title: Super Heavy Booster Catch (Demo Only)
description:  (I have never been employed by / affiliated with SpaceX. This is for demo use only) 
    Developing the Super Heavy booster catch project involves designing a robust launch tower with "chopstick" arms, advanced control systems for precise booster alignment, and integrating sophisticated software for real-time trajectory adjustments and structural engineering to handle immense forces.
skills: 
  - Structural analysis
  - Aerodynamic design
  - Propulsion system integration
  - Control Algorithem 
  - Welding
  - Metal forming
  - Thermal simulation

## Overview
Autonomy stack for **semantic exploration and dense object mapping** with Boston Dynamics **Spot**. The system separates **mapping** and **planning** concerns, then couples them through a clean interface: mapping delivers reliable background and object-level models; planning guarantees coverage and required multi-view object observations with short, consistent paths. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
