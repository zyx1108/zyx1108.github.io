# Hero Section
name: Yixuan Zhao
headline: Robotics Engineer — Perception, Planning & Reliable Autonomy
description: >- # dont remove this line. this will ignore all new lines until the next section
  I studied Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering for my B.S. and Mechanical Engineering for my M.S. 
  With that foundation, I build robotics solutions that respect real-world dynamics—taking sensor fusion, 
  mapping, and motion planning from analysis and simulation to production-ready autonomy measured by coverage, 
  efficiency, and operational safety.
